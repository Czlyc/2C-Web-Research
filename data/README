>> File Description:
1. 'raw' : contains the transformed data. Transformation 
   is done by randome sequence and kept secret to Pili only. 

>> Raw Data Format -- 'node'
line format: nodeid '\t' label

This is the node information data. 'label' is transformed
version of institution. For the observer, he/she may have 
several institutions. In this case, the institution label 
is set to the biggest one based on our knowledge. 

>> Raw Data Format -- 'label'
line format: nodeid1 '\t' nodeid2

The link is directed. That means, from the observer's point
of view, we can crawl 'nodeid2''s from 'nodeid1''s buddy 
list. However, use it as bidirectional link is OK, since 
renren.com is a symmetric topology.
