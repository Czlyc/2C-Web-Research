>>'post.login' sample

'post.login.template' contains a string: 'origURL=%2Fhome.do&email={login email address}&password={password}&login=%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95'

If your email address for renren.com is 'abc@xyz.com' and your password is '123', the resultant 'post.login' file should be:
'origURL=%2Fhome.do&email=abc@xyz.com&password=123&login=%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95'

>>Test Data Check:

You should see these files under 'data' directory after 'test.sh':
1. 'rootid', which contains your renren ID
2. 'data.friend1', which contains two lines of level one friends
3. 'data.friend2', each file corresponds to one of the level one friends. 
    data format is the same as that of 'data.friend1'

Your data will be isomorphically transformed before we use it in the successive study. In order to protect every participant, the transformation formula will be kept secret to HU, Pili only.
