The is the guide regarding the use of our Renren Crawler.

>>Important Notice

This folder may contain your personal data(including login 
account). Please DO NOT share it with anyone else. The 
author only asks for 'data' directory, which contains the 
topology and institution label. 

>>System Requirement:
1. bash
2. wget
3. perl

>>Usage:

Before you start, please try login '3g.renren.com' using 
a browser. If you always encounter validation code(验证码),
the following full automated procedure can not work. 
Please jump to the section 'Manual Login'.

1. copy 'info/post.login.template' to 'info/post.login'
2. modify 'post.login' using your own account(see below for details)
3. issue command: bash ./test.sh
    (estimated to be several seconds)
4. check data files in 'data' directory against this 'Guide'
    (See section 'Test Data Check')
5. issue command: nohup bash ./run.sh & 
    (estimated to be several hours)
6. you can watch the progress using: tail -f log
7. if you see this line "[./run.sh]===end===", the crawling completes. 

>>'post.login' sample

'post.login.template' contains a string: 
'origURL=%2Fhome.do&email={login email address}&password={password}&login=%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95'
(without quotes)

Assume your email address for renren.com is 'abc@xyz.com'
(inside the single quotes) and your password is '1#2&3': 
1. Encode the account:(don't miss quotes)
    $./encoder.sh 'abc@xyz.com'
    abc%40xyz.com
2. Encode the password:
	$./encoder.sh '1#2&3'
	1%232%263
3. Substitute variables in 'post.login' using the encoded 
   version accordingly. The resultant 'post.login' file should be:
'origURL=%2Fhome.do&email=abc%40xyz.com&password=1%232%263&login=%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95'
(without quotes)

>>Test Data Check:

You should see these files under 'data' directory after 'test.sh':
1. 'rootid', which contains your renren ID
2. 'data.friend1', which contains two lines of level one friends
3. 'data.friend2', each file corresponds to one of the level one friends. 
    data format is the same as that of 'data.friend1'

If you see non-meaningful output there, that means the test fails.
Please see 'Troubleshooting for Failed Test' for further process. 
Otherwise, the test succeeds, and please proceed to the formal 
crawling procedure using 'run.sh'. 

>>Troubleshooting for Failed Test:

1. Login 3g.renren.com using a browser. If you always encounter 
   validation code, you may need to check the 'Manual Login' 
   section. 
2. Check 'tmp/home.html'. If you see an identical home page as 
   logging in with the browser, the login process is successful. 
   Otherwise, it fails. 
3. Please send console output and 'log' file to Pili for further 
   troubleshooting. 

>>Manual Login

There are three steps in general:
   1. Login using your browser. 
   2. Modify 'info/user-agent' using the corresponding agent 
      string of your browser; export cookies from you browser
      to file 'tmp/cookies'. 
   3. Use './test-nologin.sh' to test; use 'run-nologin.sh'
      to start formal crawling. 

Detailed description for Firefox:
   1. Install two plugins: "httpfox", "export cookies". 
   2. Start "httpfox". (shift + F2, or from the menu)
   3. Push "start" to capture http message. 
   4. Login renren.com and visit your own homepage. 
   5. Stop capturing and find one record whose URL is:
      'http://3g.renren.com/profile.do?id=xxxxxxxx'
   6. From the 'Headers' panel, read the 'User-Agent' string. 
   7. Copy the UA string to file 'info/user-agent'. 
   8. Choose menu 'Tools -> Export Cookies'. 
   9. Save the file to 'tmp/cookies'. 

   10. Issue command: 'bash ./test-nologin.sh'
   11. Check data in directory 'data'. 
   12. (if test is passed)
   	   Issue command: 'bash ./run-nologin.sh'

Note that steps after (9) is the same as normal operation, 
except for the scripts are '-nologin' version. 

Other browsers can do the same job, but I don't know the 
shortcut to perform this task. 

>>Policy of Privacy 

Many thanks if you can provide your data in 'data' directory 
to the authors. We will never share this raw data with any 
3rd party. Your data will be isomorphically transformed before 
we use it in the successive study. In order to protect every 
participant, the transformation formula will be kept secret 
to HU, Pili only.
