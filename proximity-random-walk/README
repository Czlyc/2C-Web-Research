proximity measurements, random walk based
1. Pagerank
2. Personalized Pagerank
   2.1 Unsupervised version(only root node share escape probability)
   2.2 Semi-supervised version(a set of given node)
3. Simrank(*)

(*) Not implemented due to lack of time. 

>>Interface Description

All three Pagerank related algorithms will be implemented 
through a uniform interface -- the most generalized version.

INPUT: 
   1. 'link' file from each observer. 
      in the format:
      "nodeID1" "\t" "nodeID2"
      
   2. 'escape-vector' file(diff for three versions)
      in the format:
      "nodeID" "\t" "weight"

NOTICE: 
   1. The "weight" field in 'escape-vector' need not be normalized. 
      The PR calculator will normalize it for you. Nodes that are
      not set in this file will be initialized with 0 weight. 
   2. Links in the 'link' file provided to this program is regarded 
      as unidirectional edge. For bidirectional edge, just copy the 
      two columns in reverse order and cat it to the original file. 
      This is for more flexible control outside binary executable. 
      A sample command can be:
         awk -F"\t" 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"}{print $1,$2; print $2,$1}' link.uni > link.bi

OUTPUT:
   1. the random walk reach probability. 
      in the format:
      "nodeID" "\t" "probability"
