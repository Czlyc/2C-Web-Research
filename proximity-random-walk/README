proximity measurements, random walk based
1. Pagerank
2. Personalized Pagerank
   2.1 Unsupervised version(only root node share escape probability)
   2.2 Semi-supervised version(a set of given node)
3. Simrank(*)

(*) Not implemented due to lack of time. 

>>Interface Description

All three Pagerank related algorithms will be implemented 
through a uniform interface -- the most generalized version.

INPUT: 
   1. 'link' file from each observer. 
   2. 'escape-vector' file(diff for three versions)
      in the format:
      "nodeID" "\t" "weight"

The "weight" field in 'escape-vector' need not be normalized. 
The PR calculator will normalize it for you. 

OUTPUT:
   1. the random walk reach probability. 
      in the format:
      "nodeID" "\t" "probability"
